# Road Trip Data

This repo was originally forked from [Winston Hearn](http://winstonhearn.co). It has been modified by Devin Bartley to loop through a csv spreadsheet of multiple road trips to output a geojson file of each trip route. The script uses the Google Directions API and then translates the data to GeoJSON.
